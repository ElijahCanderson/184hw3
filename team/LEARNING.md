# Android:

  Benefits: 

Easy to visualize user interface,
Build/run features are simple and quick,
Easy to customize the app,
Similar to existing/popular IDE IntelliJ,
Native performance benefits,
Built in emulator for a wide variety of phones and tablets,

  Challenges:
  
No iOS support,
Testing and debugging,
Emulator vs real device (I heard it’s different),
Fragmentation  

# React Native:

  Benefits: 
 
Cross platform,
More similar to previous projects with web-dev,
No need for an Android/Iphone device or emulation,
If you have experience with React, it can be easier to use,

  Challenges: 
 
It might require specific versions of maven and node.js in order to work,
JavaScript Library, making it a steeper learning curve.,
Expo Go sometimes glitches ,
If you are working in a public network, you might need to use “–tunnel” to make it work (it might ask you to download more things),
Performance issues compared to native development.
