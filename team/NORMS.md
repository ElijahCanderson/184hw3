Group 10 NORMS:
# If you cannot make it to class, please let us know as soon as possible so we can plan around it.
# Meet once per week (at least) outside of class, usually on Zoom, for at least 30 minutes with a clear agenda.
# Check in regularly with teammates (e.g., daily chat updates or quick stand-ups).
# Don’t hesitate to ask for help—no question is too small or unimportant.
# Document your code thoroughly to ensure others can understand and contribute.
# Always make a branch before committing to main to keep the repository organized.
# Use git rebase where possible to maintain clean commit history and reduce merge conflicts.
# Notify teammates before taking over their work and coordinate changes to avoid duplication.
# Keep the kanban board updated by marking progress, noting blockers, and clearly assigning tasks.
