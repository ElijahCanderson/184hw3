Meeting notes for Zoom meeting 10/17 (Week 3)

# Sprint planning

Today's Scribe: Maya Rosenbaum

Today's Scrum Master: Mariana Rosillo

# What Will We Do?
* Madison: User Story: Chris Gaucho is using a mobile app and wants a simple interface to toggle between pages like homepage, history, and settings
* Maya: User Story: Sally wants to be able to search common drinks from a database to easily input drinks
* Ivan: User Story: Jose wants to be able to input his weight and height into the app, so that it can provide more accurate estimates of his Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) and track his alcohol consumption based on his personal attributes.
* Mariana: User Story: Joe wants to know what his BAC is as he is drinking.
* Elijah: User Story: Joana wants privacy and security when it comes to get drinking habits. She wants some sort of authentication.

# How Will We Do It?
* Ivan: To accomplish this user story, update the database schema to store weight and height, modify the user profile UI to input this data, and refactor the BAC calculation algorithm to include weight for more accurate estimates.
* Madison: design 3 composables accessible via a locked visual navigation bar across the appâ€™s interface
* Maya: Update database to store extensive list of common drinks and associated stats (alcohol content)
* Mariana: To complete this, create a program that computes the BAC based on alcohol consumption, weight, and height.
* Elijah: Set up a google authentication sign in upon opening the app intially. (Perhaps required for all users or not)
